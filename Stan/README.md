# Stan files
This folder contains three stan files used in the paper. The file `model1.stan` implements our main model, where the structured spatial term ($\phi_s$) follows an Intrinsic Conditional Auto-Regressive (ICAR) prior, and the structured temporal term ($\nu_t$) follows a random walk (RW) prior. The unstructured spatial ($\theta_s$) and temporal ($\xi_t$) effects, along with the spatio-temporal interaction term ($\psi_{rt}$), which models province-level time trend variations, are assigned independent normal priors. All variance parameters are assigned Penalized Complexity (PC) priors with the specification $Pr(\sigma_u > 1) = 0.01$. The file `model2.stan` follows the same model structure as model 1 but replaces the PC priors with half-Cauchy priors, using a scale parameter of 1. The file `model3.stan` is also similar to model 1 but differs in that the spatio-temporal interaction term ($\psi_{st}$) models time trend variations at the district level instead of the province level.
